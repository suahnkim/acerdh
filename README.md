This is an implementation of paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7368603 with optimization of lowest peak selection when there are multiple options. 

To run an example: 
run "main.m" in matlab

This is vector optimized implementation. A code that is easier to understand will be uploaded in the future.
